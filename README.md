# Handpan-for-NT <br>

Attempt to create a "realistic" Handpan algorithm for the Disting NT<br>

# ATTENTION THE PLUGIN WORKS NOT EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT TO DO
# Slowly it is becoming a stable version, last tests needed 
<br>
-18 June 2025 added another version, it works but I have to figure out why it clicks at each gate
<br>
-19 june 2025 tests ongoing on Base Freq CV input, solved one issue and created another one, as usual 
<br>
-19 June2025 fixed Cv ins, some test are still needed but it seems usable
<br>
-19 June 2025 added 2 Trig/Gate ins and 2 Note CV ins to simulate a two hands instrument
<br>
like it is in reality, also added a few different resonators and made minor fixes.
