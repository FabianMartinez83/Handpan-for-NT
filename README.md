# Handpan-for-NT <br>

Attempt to create a "realistic" Handpan algorithm for the Disting NT<br>

# VERSION 1.0.0 release
# Last tests ended Sat 21 June 2025 enjoy the algo
<br>
-21 Jun 2025 release the stable v.1.0.0 with and without UI. I had no time to write a User Manual, sorry 
<br>
you will not need a User Manual it's very simple to figure out how to use this algo.
<br> 
IN1 & IN2 are Gate In, IN3 & IN4 are Note CV In. OUT 1 & 2 for Stereo out
<br>
IN5 is for a CV Fader to change the Base frequency, IN6 CV in for the Decay, IN7 fo the Exciter 
<br>
I reccomend to use CV faders or smooth LFO, I also reccomend to not use high Tempo to trigger the gates
<br>
Handpan is a Instrument that is played gently and therefore I reccomend to do it also with that algo.
